Two snps associated with the APOE gene are known to be highly predictive of Alzheimer's. Our goal was to find other SNPs or SNP based features that would predict cognitive scores for dementia and Alzheimer's.

We started out with approximately 12 million genetic features (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) for ADNI and AddNeuroMed cites.
